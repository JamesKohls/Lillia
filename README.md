# Lillia

Lillia is a project based off the character "Lillia" from League of Legends. She is constructed from modified Cylinder and Sphere Primitives and rigged with joints with the torso as their origin. 

## Demonstration

Lillia is hosted [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) with Github Pages.


## Usage

Users may manipulate Lillia with the use of the sliders. Lillia has two animations: Walk and Wave, with a special animation by holding shift and clicking over the canvas. Pressing the Stand button will return Lillia to Idle animation.
